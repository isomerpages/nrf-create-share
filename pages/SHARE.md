SHARE was established in 2016 to advance and strengthen research collaborations between Israel and Singapore. SHARE serves as an intellectual hub for  research, scholarship, entrepreneurship and postgraduate/postdoctoral training, bringing together leading scientists from both countries to tackle major global challenges . It is the only international research center of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem outside of Israel.

Currently, SHARE has one major research project. For details on this project and several others, please visit our website at [https://www.share-huj.com/](https://www.share-huj.edu.sg/)

**Smart Grippers for Soft Robotics** is a new research program in the field of soft robotics that is based on a collaboration between The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with the participation of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

The main research and development in this program will be devoted towards fabrication of soft, smart grippers. Gripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. Examples for the need of soft gripper include situations where very different objects need to be gripped reliably and in rapid succession. Another situation where such a gripper has a significant advantage over traditional designs is when a detailed shape or material properties of the target object are not known a priori, or when precise positioning is not feasible. This program we will focus on investigating and developing simultaneous gripping and sensing materials, based on principles of soft robotics. These smart materials will adapt and conform autonomously to the surface of the target object, while addressing the unmet needs in the field of soft robotics.

The program will be based on three main pillars of interconnected activities: Actuation, Sensing and Control.
